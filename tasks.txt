# Important
1. superglobals.php - form submissions don't work
1. Group Management
1.1 List of contacts (inherited ones included) for a certain group
1.2 Create groups and dd contacts to groups
1.3. Connect groups
1.3.1 Connected groups inherit contacts
2. More documentation in code (especially for boilerplate)

# Not-urgent
1. Display errors (no database connection, class autoloader fails, form submission fails etc)
2. Automatically generate setters and getters for Form objects
3. Get rid of static functions (if possible) because in many cases classes are just a collection of functions
4. Submenu

# Working on: group_dao.php, group_connection_dao.php,
